- [Teams](https://teams.microsoft.com) Microsoft Teams is installed and you have an account

## Setup

1. App Registration
Register a new application in the [Microsoft Entra ID â€“ App Registrations](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2083908) portal.

2. Setup for Bot
In Azure portal, create a [Azure Bot resource](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/bot-service/bot-builder-authentication?view=azure-bot-service-4.0&tabs=csharp%2Caadv2).

- Ensure that you've [enabled the Teams Channel](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/bot-service/channel-connect-teams?view=azure-bot-service-4.0)

3. Run Dev Tunnel

1) Run the `dev tunnels`. Please follow [Create and host a dev tunnel](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/dev-tunnels/get-started?tabs=windows) and host the tunnel with anonymous user access command as shown below:
   > NOTE: Go to your project directory and open the `./Properties/launchSettings.json` file. Check the port number and update it to match your DevTunnel port. If `./Properties/launchSettings.json`not fount Close and re-open the solution.launchSettings.json have been re-created.
 
   ```bash
   devtunnel host -p 3978 --allow-anonymous
   ```

4. Setup for code

- Clone the repository

    ```bash
    git clone https://dynamicscrm@dev.azure.com/dynamicscrm/OneCRM/_git/Microsoft.Agents.Sdk
    ```

## To try this sample

  - If you are using Visual Studio
 
  - Launch Visual Studio
  - File -> Open Folder
   - Select `Microsoft.CopilotStudio.SDK.sln` file and open it in Visual Studio
   - Navigate to `samples/teams/PeoplePicker` folder
   - Select `PeoplePicker.csproj`.

#### Configuring authentication in the Bot People Picker adaptive card Sample Project

To configure authentication into the Bot People Picker adaptive card Sample Project you will need the following information:

1. Client ID of the Application identity you wish to use.
1. Client Secret of the Application identity you wish to use or the Certificate that has been registered for the Client ID in Entra AD

Once you have that information, to configure authentication, Open the `appsettings.json` file in the root of the sample project.

Find the section labeled `Connections`,  it should appear similar to this:

```json
"Connections": {
  "BotServiceConnection": {
    "Assembly": "Microsoft.Agents.Authentication.Msal",
    "Type":  "MsalAuth",
    "Settings": {
      "AuthType": "ClientSecret", // this is the AuthType for the connection, valid values can be found in Microsoft.Agents.Authentication.Msal.Model.AuthTypes.  The default is ClientSecret.
      "AuthorityEndpoint": "https://login.microsoftonline.com/botframework.com",
      "ClientId": "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000", // this is the Client ID used for the connection.
      "ClientSecret": "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000", // this is the Client Secret used for the connection.
      "Scopes": [
        "https://api.botframework.com/.default"
      ],
      "TenantId": "" // This is the Tenant ID used for the Connection. 
    }
  }
```

1. Set the **AuthType** to either `ClientSecret` or `Certificate`
1. Set the **ClientId** to the Client Id of your identity
1. if you chose `ClientSecret`
    1. Set the ClientSecret to the Secret that was created for your identity.
1. if you chose `Certificate`
    1. Import the PFX Certificate to your local machine and note which certificate store it was loaded into.
    1. Replace the key **ClientSecret** with **CertificateThumbPrint** and set the value of the **CertificateThumbPrint** to the thumbprint of your certificate
1. Set the **TenantId** to the Tenant Id where your application is registered.
   
5. Setup Manifest for Teams
- __*This step is specific to Teams.*__
    - **Edit** the `manifest.json` contained in the ./appManifest folder to replace your Microsoft App Id(Client ID) (that was created when you registered your app registration earlier) *everywhere* you see the place holder string `{{Microsoft-App-Id}}` (depending on the scenario the Microsoft App Id may occur multiple times in the `manifest.json`)   
    - **Zip** up the contents of the `appManifest` folder to create a `manifest.zip` (Make sure that zip file does not contains any subfolder otherwise you will get error while uploading your .zip package)

- Upload the manifest.zip to Teams (in the Apps view click "Upload a custom app")
   - Go to Microsoft Teams. From the lower left corner, select Apps
   - From the lower left corner, choose Upload a custom App
   - Go to your project directory, the ./appManifest folder, select the zip folder, and choose Open.
   - Select Add in the pop-up dialog box. Your app is uploaded to Teams.
