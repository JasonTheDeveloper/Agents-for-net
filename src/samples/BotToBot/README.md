# BotToBot

This Sample contains two bots, Bot1 and Bot2, that represent the two legs of a Bot to Bot communication sequence using Copilot SDK Skills. Each bot has its own read me to setup and configure the bot.  

Found here:

Its a good idea to individually test each bot to make sure its alive before proceeding.

## Key concepts in this sample

The solution includes a parent bot (`Bot1`) and a bot (`Bot2`) and shows how the Bot1 can post activities to the Bot2 and returns the bot responses to the user.

- `SimpleRootBot`: this project shows how to consume an echo skill and includes:
  - A [RootBot](SimpleRootBot/Bots/RootBot.cs) that calls the echo skill and keeps the conversation active until the user says "end" or "stop". [RootBot](SimpleRootBot/Bots/RootBot.cs) also keeps track of the conversation with the skill and handles the `EndOfConversation` activity received from the skill to terminate the conversation
  - A [SkillController](SimpleRootBot/Controllers/SkillController.cs) that handles skill responses
- `EchoBot`: this project shows a simple echo skill that receives message activities from the parent bot and echoes what the user said. This project includes:
  - A sample [EchoBot](EchoBot/Bots/EchoBot.cs) that shows how to send EndOfConversation based on the message sent to the skill and yield control back to the parent bot
  - A [sample bot manifest](EchoBot/wwwroot/manifest/echobot-manifest-1.0.json) that describes what the skill can do

## Testing the bot using Emulator

[Bot Framework Emulator](https://github.com/microsoft/botframework-emulator) is a desktop application that allows bot developers to test and debug their bots on localhost or running remotely through a tunnel.

- Install the Bot Framework Emulator version 4.7.0 or greater from [here](https://github.com/Microsoft/BotFramework-Emulator/releases)

### Connect to the bot using Bot Framework Emulator

- Launch Bot Framework Emulator
- File -> Open Bot
- Enter a Bot URL of `http://localhost:3978/api/messages`

## Deploy the bots to Azure
